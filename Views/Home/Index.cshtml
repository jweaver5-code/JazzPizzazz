            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Raised in a home where music was the heartbeat of daily life, I learned early on to appreciate the power
                of rhythm and melody. Inspired by my grandfather, I developed a deep passion for the saxophone and
                piano, which continue to shape my creative perspective today.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my hometown, I worked for four years at a family-owned pizzeria that holds a special place in my
                family's history—each generation has contributed to the business, just like the owners themselves.
                During my time there, I gained firsthand experience in the day-to-day operations of running a pizza
                restaurant, from crafting quality food to understanding the importance of strong customer relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                These experiences sparked a vision: to create a pizzeria that combines the joy of music with the warmth
                of community. My goal is to build a place where customers feel uplifted by the atmosphere, energized by
                the tunes, and truly welcomed—as if they were part of our extended music family.
            </p>
